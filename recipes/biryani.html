    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful South Asian rice dish that beautifully blends basmati rice with tender meat, aromatic spices, and herbs. 
            Whether made with chicken, beef, mutton, or even vegetables, 
            biryani is known for its rich layers of flavor and its enticing aroma. 
            Each bite offers a perfect balance of spice and savoriness, 
            often enhanced with ingredients like <strong>saffron, fried onions, yogurt, 
            and fresh coriander</strong>. Traditionally cooked using the "dum" method, 
            where the pot is sealed and slow-cooked, 
            biryani is more than just a meal — it’s a celebration on a plate.</p>
