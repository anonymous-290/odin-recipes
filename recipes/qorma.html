    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Qorma is a rich and flavorful South Asian curry made with meat slow-cooked in a blend of aromatic spices, yogurt, and fried onions. 
            Known for its thick, silky gravy, qorma is often prepared with chicken, mutton, or beef and is popular at weddings 
            and special occasions. The dish is delicately spiced—using ingredients like 
            cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves—creating a deep, royal flavor. 
            Typically served with naan, roti, or rice, qorma is a comforting and 
            luxurious meal that showcases the essence of traditional Mughlai cuisine.</p>
